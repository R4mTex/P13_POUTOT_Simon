                <p>Hello, after a few years studying computer science, I've come to realize my final project: "ToolShare".</p>
                <p>The constraints were to create something community-oriented that would be useful around my home.</p>
                <p>Living in the countryside, I've already been able to take part in a few projects requiring specific tools.
                As I don't have a DIY workshop, and professional tool hire is expensive, we asked around the house if any
                friends/neighbors could lend us their equipment.
                Unfortunately, we didn't know in advance whether the person in question had the tool or whether it was available, which
                sometimes worked to our disadvantage and blocked the job for a few days.</p>
